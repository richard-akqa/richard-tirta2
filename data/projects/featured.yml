  description: "Previously, Sutterfield had a Wordpress website and inconsistent branding across the board. I was able to straigthen it up and remade the website so it is linked to Flickr instead of updating every single changing inventory. With social media management and analytical strategies I was able to increase traffic significantly."

  description: "iPhone 6 isn’t simply bigger — it’s better in every way. Larger, yet dramatically thinner. More powerful, but remarkably power efficient. With a smooth metal surface that seamlessly meets the new Retina HD display. It’s one continuous form where hardware and software function in perfect unison, creating a new generation of iPhone that’s better by any measure."
